# ♻️ Waste Classification Web App
As a part of the internship in Edunet Foundation i woked on a project Waste Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

This project is a web-based waste classification system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify waste images as Recyclable or Organic. The goal is to promote smart and sustainable waste management using artificial intelligence.

## 📌 Features

Upload waste images through a web interface

Real-time prediction using a trained CNN model

Displays the uploaded image and the predicted category

Clean, user-friendly interface styled with HTML & CSS

Built with Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV

## 🧠 Model Info

CNN model trained on a labeled dataset of waste images

Classes: Recyclable Waste, Organic Waste

Trained using TensorFlow/Keras

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Jinja (Flask templating)

Backend: Python, Flask

Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Keras
